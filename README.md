# face-filters

Over the years there has been a giant influx of filters over various social apps like Snap Inc., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and many more. Some filters got so popular that they defined the app.

Its been a long time interest for me, how are they made and how are they deployed? Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AR, 3D rendering and what not.

Each social media company uses its own tech stack or method to do it. There are even companies who found a niche in this.

Here's a implementation of face filters using OpenCV and Face point detection.
